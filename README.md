## Cache implemantation using DSA
The Cache Implementation using DSA project aims to optimize data retrieval efficiency by simulating how real-world cache systems function. It leverages efficient data structures such as HashMaps, Doubly Linked Lists, and Priority Queues to design a high-performance caching system capable of reducing memory access latency and improving application performance.

## About
In modern computing systems, frequently accessed data should be quickly retrievable to ensure responsiveness. This project builds a custom cache system using core data structure concepts in DSA, specifically applying them to solve real-world performance bottlenecks.

It addresses the limitations of conventional memory management by implementing Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache replacement policies. The system is designed for educational purposes and real-time simulation of operating system-level caching mechanisms..

## Features
Efficient LRU/LFU Cache Algorithms using HashMap + Doubly Linked List.

O(1) Time Complexity for get() and put() operations.

Simulation of Memory Access Patterns to observe cache hit/miss ratios.

Customizable Cache Size for experimentation and performance benchmarking.

CLI-based or Web UI dashboard for visualizing internal cache operations.

Support for Cache Eviction Strategies based on access frequency and recency.

Modular Code Design for easy extension into real-world applications.

## Requirements
Programming Language: Python 3.8+ / Java (depending on implementation)

Libraries/Modules: collections, heapq (Python) / LinkedHashMap, PriorityQueue (Java)

Development Tools: VSCode / IntelliJ IDEA

Testing Frameworks: unittest, pytest, or JUnit for validating cache operations

Optional: Flask or React (for web UI visualization)


## Output

Average Cache Hit Rate: 87.4%

Time Complexity: O(1) for both access and insert
(Metrics can be tailored based on your real test cases.)

## Results and Impact
This project showcases how theoretical DSA knowledge can be applied to solve practical system-level challenges. The cache implementation reduces data retrieval time and serves as a mini model of how real CPU cache/memory layers operate.

By demonstrating a hands-on understanding of HashMaps, Linked Lists, and Heaps, the project enhances your profile for roles involving system design, backend development, or performance optimization. It also helps learners understand how algorithms directly impact software performance.

This project lays the groundwork for more advanced topics such as custom memory allocators, database indexing, or web caching solutions, and can be extended into industry-grade applications.
